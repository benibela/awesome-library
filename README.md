Awesome Library Tools and Resources
===================================

More and more tools and projects by and for libraries are becoming available on
the internet. We would like to curate a list of various software, tools,
resources and projects, which are useful when working within a library context.

At the moment, this is a single list, but at some point, we should group the
links as some categories emerge.

Contributions welcome.
